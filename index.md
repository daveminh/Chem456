# Course Description

A project-based introduction to computer-aided drug design tools and the principles behind them. Structural alignment and homology modeling. Molecular docking and molecular mechanics force fields for binding enthalpies. Continuum dielectric models of electrostatics and solvation. The Boltzmann distribution and alchemical binding free energy calculations. Quantitative structure property relationships. Business, legal, and ethical considerations of drug development.

# Learning Objectives

Upon completing this course, you should be able to:

* Set up, perform, and analyze a few types of calculations common in computer-aided drug design: structural alignments, homology modeling, electrostatics calculations, molecular docking, molecular dynamics simulations, and binding free energy calculations.
* Explain tradeoffs in computational speed and accuracy inherent to various computer-aided drug design methods.
* Analyze and present the prospects of a biological macromolecule (usually a protein) as a target for ligand design, from both a scientific and from a business perspective.
* Determine whether the synthesis or specified use of a molecule falls under patent protection.
* Describe ethical issues relevant to the pharmaceutical industry including the balance between access to medicines and incentives for research and development and informed consent in clinical trials.
