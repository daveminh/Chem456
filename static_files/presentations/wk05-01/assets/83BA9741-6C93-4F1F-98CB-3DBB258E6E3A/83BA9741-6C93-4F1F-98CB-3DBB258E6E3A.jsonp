Chemical bonds and atomic angles are modeled using simple springs, and dihedral angles (that is, rotations about a bond) are modeled using a sinusoidal function that approximates the energy differences between eclipsed and staggered conformations. Non-bonded forces arise due to van der Waals interactions, modeled using the Lennard-Jones potential, and charged (electrostatic) interactions, modeled using Coulomb's law.
