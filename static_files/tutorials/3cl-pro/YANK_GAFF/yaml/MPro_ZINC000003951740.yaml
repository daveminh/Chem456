  restraint:
    type: Harmonic # Keep the ligand near the protein
    # We set a harmonic restraint which biases the ligand to remain close to the receptor when it is decoupled
    # to prevent it from drifting into the whole box and possibly never visiting the binidng site again.
    # The Harmonic restraint is fairly weak since it restrains a single ligand atom to the centroid-most receptor atom,
    # which may or may not be a binding site.
    # The restraint is opposite the coupling parameter since we want the ligand unrestrained in the binding site
    # We correct for the free energy of this restraint through the `standard_state_correction` calculated automatically.
