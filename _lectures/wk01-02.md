Select a personal target to do further research on. The target or a close homolog must have a public crystal structure in the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org). After making sure that nobody has selected the same target, enter your name and target in the [Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iaSiJNi3YfHuG2_asuYWpRpvoEVHWazjbY5Ebx0BKGY/edit?usp=sharing).
