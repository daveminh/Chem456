Prepare a brief presentation about your personal target, as described under Assignments. If you want to include electrostatics calculations, the [APBS and PDQ2PQR home page](http://www.poissonboltzmann.org) and [PDB2PQR server](http://nbcr-222.ucsd.edu/pdb2pqr_2.1.1/) could be useful. Upload a PDF file named XXXX_YYYY.pdf (where XXXX is the 4-letter PDB ID and YYYY is your last name) to the BiologicalTargetPresentations directory on Google Drive by midnight on February 3.
