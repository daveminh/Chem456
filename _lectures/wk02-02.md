We suggesting managing sources using [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org)
(The library has a [Zotero guide](https://guides.library.iit.edu/c.php?g=720120&p=5131065)).

Patent searches can be done at [US Patent Office](http://patft.uspto.gov/netahtml/PTO/search-bool.html) and the [World Intellectual Property Organization "patentscope"](https://patentscope.wipo.int/).
Chemistry-related searches can be done with [PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).

For homework, [export your references as a Zotero RDF]({{ "/static_files/tutorials/zotero_export.pdf" | prepend: site.baseurl }}), create a directory with the PDB ID of your target within the Literature directory on Google Drive, and copy your references into your folder by midnight on January 27.
