### Individual

* **Biological Target Presentation File**. All students will give a short presentation (8 minutes) about the scientific and business prospects of developing a ligand for a biological target of their own choice.

In the presentation, students should address the criterion discussed in class on 1/16. The presentation should cite some of the articles/patents found during a database/literature search, as discussed on 1/16, 1/21, and 1/23. Citations should be numbered/named on individual slides and an ACS-style bibliography included at the end. The presentation should also include results from at least one of the calculations discussed on 1/28 and 1/30 - structural alignment, electrostatics calculations, or homology modeling - for the biological target. For example, a structural alignment could be used to assess the similarity between the binding site of bacterial and human homologues. I-TASSER could be used to generate a model. The presentation could include information about the level of confidence in the model.

All the presentations should be uploaded as a PDF file named XXXX_YYYY.pdf (where XXXX is the 4-letter PDB ID and YYYY is your last name) to the BiologicalTargetPresentations directory on Google Drive by midnight on February 3.

On February 4 and 6, students will be randomly selected to present. To expedite the process, students will all present using the instructor's laptop.

The presentation will be evaluated according to the following 100 point rubric: Does the presentation address (1) disease relevance, e.g. mechanistic rationale or mutations [40 pts]? and (2) structural properties, e.g structural resolution and druggability [10 pts]? Were structural alignment, electrostatics, or structural prediction calculations included [25 pts]? Was the presentation clear and concise (within 8 minutes) [15 pts]? Were references properly cited [10 pts]?

* **Pharmaceutical Ethics Report File**. All students will write a 2-3 page summary of discussions related to pharmaceutical ethics.

* **Individual Contribution Reports Survey**. All students will write two brief reports that describe their contribution to the project since the previous report. The reports will be filed as answers to an online survey. The reports will be assessed based on clarity, completeness, and credibility. They will be an important factor in the individual grade.

* **Project Portfolio**. All students are asked to write a project portfolio, which describes the skills they have developed over the course of the project. It will be an important factor in the individual contribution grade.

### Team

* **Midterm Presentation File**. Teams are required to present a midterm (a 10-15 minute project update) presentation about their project.

In the presentation, teams should review and expand on (if warranted) the scientific background information and calculations (e.g. homology modeling, structural alignment, and electrostatics) described in the individual biological target presentation. They should also describe progress on new calculations that have been performed (docking and molecular dynamics), analyses that have been performed (e.g. equilibration time, dimensionality reduction, clustering, and Markov state models), scientific understanding gained, predictions made, and what additional calculations they plan to perform and what they expect to learn from them.

All the presentations should be uploaded as a PDF file named XXXX.pdf (where XXXX is the 4-letter PDB ID) to the MidtermPresentations directory on Google Drive by midnight on March 9.

On March 10, teams will be randomly selected to present. Teams can present using either the instructor's or a member's laptop.

The presentation will be evaluated according to the following 100 point rubric: Does the presentation clearly address the scientific rationale of the project? [20 pts] Were structural alignment, electrostatics, or structural prediction calculations included and clearly explained? [10 pts] Were molecular docking calculations and analyses included and clearly described [25 pts]? Were molecular dynamics simulations and analyses included (at a minimum the equilibration time) and clearly described [25 pts]? Was the presentation clear and concise (between 10 and 15 minutes)? [10 pts] Were references properly cited? [10 pts].

* **Final Review Presentation File**. Teams are required to give a final presentation (a 20 minute overview) about their project.
* **Final Report File**. Teams are required to create a final report or other document that captures a teamâ€™s project work in the format of a scientific journal.
* **Project Data**. Calculation results should be stored in a well-organized format and properly documented.
